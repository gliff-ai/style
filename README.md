üëã **Welcome in!** üëã

This repository contains the Open Source code for [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)‚Äôs STYLE supporting library (gliff.ai‚Äôs user-interface pattern gallery). 

STYLE documents themes and base components of gliff.ai products with a focus establishing consistency within the user-interface by using [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai) branding and human-centered design principles to ensure a unique and easily-understood user experience. When the full [gliff.ai platform](https://gliff.ai/software/) is used, STYLE provides user-interface patterns to create a consistent and user-friendly interface enabling the development of high-quality and auditable datasets that satisfy any relevant regulatory frameworks which enables our users to build world-changing and trustworthy AI models and products.

A preview build of the current `main` branch is [here](https://style.gliff.app/).

Our component storybook is [here](https://style-storybook.gliff.app/).
